I am currently enrolled in the MS in Computer Science program (concentrating in machine learning) at Columbia University in NYC, expecting to graduate May 2022. I received a BA in Statistics and Computer Science from the University of Virginia (UVA) in May 2021.

During my time at UVA, I served as CFO for The Cavalier Daily, the student-run, financially-independent news organization at the university. I also worked as a research fellow for Research for Sustainable Commerce, a group that partners with and studies local and non-local businesses dedicated to improving their social and environmental impact.

*I am actively seeking a summer 2021 internship and/or entry-level position in software engineering, data science, or artificial intelligence research. Please reach out if you know of any such opportunities or if you would simply like to connect!*
