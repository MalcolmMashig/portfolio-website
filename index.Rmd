In May 2022, I completed the MS in Computer Science program (Concentration: Machine Learning) at Columbia University in NYC. I received a BA in Statistics and Computer Science from the University of Virginia (UVA) in May 2021.

While completing my master's, I worked as a Software Engineer at Theta Equity Partners, a customer-analytics consultancy and corporate valuation service. In this position, I led a number of projects to simplify the generation of model diagnostics and client-facing visualizations. In June 2022, I started as a Junior Data Scientist at the same company. 

During my time at UVA, I served as CFO for The Cavalier Daily, the student-run, financially-independent news organization at the university. I also worked as a research fellow for Research for Sustainable Commerce, a group that partners with and studies local and non-local businesses dedicated to improving their social and environmental impact.
