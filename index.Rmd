I am currently enrolled in the MS in Computer Science program at Columbia University in NYC, concentrating in machine learning. I received a BA in Statistics and Computer Science from the University of Virginia (UVA) in May 2021.

During my time at UVA, I served as CFO for The Cavalier Daily, the student-run, financially-independent news organization at the university. I also worked as a research fellow for Research for Sustainable Commerce, a customer analytics group that partners with and studies local and non-local businesses dedicated to improving their social and environmental impact.
